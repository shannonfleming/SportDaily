**World Cup security concerns have been raised due to a funding freeze, with host cities warning Congress about the potential risks.**

## Context / Background
The World Cup is one of the most widely viewed and followed sporting events globally, requiring extensive security measures to ensure the safety of players, staff, and spectators. However, a funding freeze has put these security arrangements in jeopardy, prompting host cities to express their concerns to Congress.

## Tactical Key Points / Stats Table
| Host City | Security Funding Required | Current Funding Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Miami | $625m | Held up by DHS shutdown |
| Kansas City | - | Warned Congress about no security without funding |

> 'We are running out of time' - a statement that encapsulates the urgency of the situation as host cities struggle to secure the necessary funds for World Cup security.

## What's Next?
The situation is critical, with host cities like Miami considering canceling the World Cup Fan Fest due to the funding delay. Kansas City Police have also warned Congress that without the necessary funds, they cannot guarantee security for the event.
