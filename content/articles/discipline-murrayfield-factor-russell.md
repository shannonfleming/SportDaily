**England's latest Murrayfield nightmare has left fans and pundits alike searching for answers, as Scotland reclaimed the Calcutta Cup with a resounding victory.**

## Context / Background
The Six Nations championship is one of the most competitive and prestigious tournaments in international rugby. England's 12-game winning streak had sparked hopes of a strong campaign, but their defeat at Murrayfield has raised questions about their discipline and strategy.

## Tactical Key Points
England's lack of discipline was a major factor in their defeat, with Scotland's Finn Russell masterfully exploiting the English defense. The Scottish team's ability to capitalize on English mistakes and their effective use of the Murrayfield factor ultimately proved decisive.

> England's defeat will be a tough pill to swallow, but they must now regroup and focus on their next match.

## What's Next?
England will look to bounce back from this defeat in their next Six Nations match, but for now, they must ponder where it all went wrong. The team's discipline and strategy will be under scrutiny, and they will need to make significant improvements if they are to challenge for the championship.
