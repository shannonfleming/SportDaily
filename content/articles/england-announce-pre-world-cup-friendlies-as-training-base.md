**England has revealed its preparations for the upcoming World Cup, including two high-profile friendlies and a designated training base in the United States.**

## Context / Background
The England national team is gearing up for the World Cup, set to take place later this year. As part of their preparations, the team has announced two pre-tournament friendlies against New Zealand and Costa Rica. These matches will be played in south Florida, providing the team with valuable match experience before the start of the World Cup.

## Tactical Key Points / Stats Table
The friendlies against New Zealand and Costa Rica will serve as crucial warm-up matches for England. Although the exact dates and venues are not specified, these matches are expected to take place in the lead-up to the World Cup. England's training base will be located in Kansas City, Missouri, throughout their campaign.

> England's decision to base themselves in Kansas City, Missouri, is likely due to the city's top-class training facilities and relatively convenient location for travel to World Cup venues.

## What's Next?
With the pre-World Cup friendlies and training base confirmed, England can now focus on fine-tuning their squad and strategy ahead of the tournament. The team will be looking to make a strong impression in the World Cup, and these friendlies will play a crucial role in their preparations.
