**The Dallas Cowboys have officially placed the nonexclusive franchise tag on wide receiver George Pickens, ensuring he will remain with the team for the upcoming season.**

## Context / Background
The move comes as no surprise, given Pickens' impressive performance and the team's desire to retain his services. The nonexclusive franchise tag allows Pickens to negotiate with other teams, but the Cowboys will have the right to match any offer or receive two first-round draft picks as compensation if he signs elsewhere.
