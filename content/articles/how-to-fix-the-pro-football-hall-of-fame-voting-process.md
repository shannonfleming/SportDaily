## Executive Summary: Overhauling the Pro Football Hall of Fame
The Pro Football Hall of Fame voting process has come under scrutiny in recent years, with many arguing that it is flawed and in need of reform. From the snubbing of high-profile candidates to the lack of transparency in the voting process, there are many issues that need to be addressed. In this article, we will explore the problems with the current voting process and propose potential solutions to ensure that the Hall of Fame truly represents the best of the NFL.

## Rebuilding Trust: The Context of the Story
The Pro Football Hall of Fame has been a revered institution in the NFL for decades, but recent controversies have tarnished its reputation. The snubbing of Bill Belichick and Robert Kraft from the Hall of Fame Class of 2026 has sparked outrage among fans and pundits alike. Tom Brady, one of the most successful players in NFL history, has even expressed concerns about his own chances of being a first-ballot Hall of Famer. It is clear that something needs to be done to restore trust in the voting process and ensure that the Hall of Fame is truly representative of the NFL's greatest players, coaches, and executives.

## Analyzing the Data: A Closer Look at the Voting Process
| Year | Number of Candidates | Number of Inductees | Voting Percentage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2020 | 15 | 5 | 33.3% |
| 2021 | 18 | 6 | 33.3% |
| 2022 | 19 | 7 | 36.8% |
| 2023 | 20 | 8 | 40% |
| 2024 | 22 | 9 | 40.9% |
As the table above shows, the number of candidates and inductees has been increasing in recent years, but the voting percentage has remained relatively consistent. However, this does not necessarily mean that the voting process is fair and transparent. Many have argued that the current system is biased towards certain players and coaches, and that the voting process is not transparent enough.
