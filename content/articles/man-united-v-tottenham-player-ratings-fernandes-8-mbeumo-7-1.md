## How Fernandes's Masterclass Dismantled Tottenham's Defense
Manchester United secured a convincing 2-0 win over Tottenham, with Bruno Fernandes being the standout player, receiving an 8 rating for his exceptional performance. The Portuguese midfielder's vision, passing range, and goal-scoring ability were on full display as he dictated the tempo of the game. Tottenham, on the other hand, struggled to contain Fernandes and were further hindered by the sending off of Cristian Romero, who received a 1 rating for his dismal performance.

The introduction of Bryan Mbeumo, who received a 7 rating, added a new dimension to Manchester United's attack and caused problems for the Tottenham defense.
