**The International Football Association Board (IFAB) is set to discuss a proposal that could change the face of football, particularly in the Premier League, by introducing a five-second time limit for goal-kicks and throw-ins.**

## Context / Background
The long throw-in has become a staple of many teams' strategies in the Premier League, with some teams using it as a tactical weapon to catch their opponents off guard. However, this proposal could put an end to this trend.

## Tactical Key Points
The proposed time limit is aimed at speeding up the game and reducing time-wasting. The five-second limit would apply to both goal-kicks and throw-ins, and players would be required to take the kick or throw within this time frame.

> The proposal is part of IFAB's efforts to improve the flow of the game and make it more exciting for fans.

## What's Next?
The proposal will be discussed at IFAB's upcoming annual general meeting, where it will be decided whether to implement the new rule. If approved, the rule could come into effect as early as next season.
