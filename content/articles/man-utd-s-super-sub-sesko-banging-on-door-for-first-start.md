**Benjamin Sesko is knocking on the door for his first start under Michael Carrick at Manchester United after scoring three decisive goals in his last four games.**

## Context / Background
Benjamin Sesko has been in impressive form for Manchester United, scoring crucial goals as a substitute. His performances have raised questions about his role in the team and whether he should be given a starting spot.

## Tactical Key Points
Sesko's ability to make an impact off the bench has been valuable for Manchester United, but he is now pushing for a starting position. The £74m striker's goals have been decisive, and his form is hard to ignore.

> As a super sub, Sesko has made a significant impact, but starting games is the next step in his development at Manchester United.

## What's Next?
Manchester United face Crystal Palace at Old Trafford on Sunday, and Sesko will be hoping to make his first start under Michael Carrick. The question is, who will drop out to make way for him?
