    **The NBA's tanking crisis has reached an all-time high, with teams and coaches facing criticism for prioritizing draft picks over winning games.**
    ## Context / Background
    The NBA's tanking issue has been a longstanding problem, but recent events have brought it to the forefront. With multiple teams intentionally losing games to secure better draft positions, fans and pundits alike are calling for change.
    ## Tactical Key Points / Stats Table
    | Team | Wins | Losses | Draft Position |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | Jazz | 10 | 30 | 1st |
    | Rockets | 12 | 28 | 2nd |
    | Spurs | 15 | 25 | 3rd |
    Steve Kerr, coach of the Golden State Warriors, has spoken out against tanking, stating that 'it's not good for the fans.'
    > 'It's not good for the fans, it's not good for the game, and it's not good for the league as a whole.'
    ## What's Next?
    As the NBA season continues, the tanking crisis is likely to remain a major topic of discussion. The league may consider implementing reforms to discourage tanking, such as changing the draft lottery system or introducing penalties for teams that intentionally lose games.
