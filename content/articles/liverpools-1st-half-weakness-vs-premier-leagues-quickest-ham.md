**Liverpool are set to face their toughest test yet as they host West Ham, the Premier League's quickest starters, at Anfield. The Reds have been struggling with first-half weakness, a trend that could prove costly against a team that has made a habit of starting games strongly.**

## Context / Background
Liverpool have had a mixed start to the season, with some impressive victories followed by disappointing defeats. One of the common themes in their losses has been a slow start, with the team often struggling to find their rhythm in the first half. This has put additional pressure on the squad to perform in the second half, and it's an issue that manager Arne Slot has acknowledged needs to be addressed.

## Tactical Key Points / Stats Table
| Team | First-half Goals Scored | First-half Goals Conceded |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Liverpool | 5 | 8 |
| West Ham | 10 | 3 |
As the table shows, West Ham have been one of the most potent teams in the first half, scoring 10 goals and conceding just 3. Liverpool, on the other hand, have struggled to find the back of the net in the first 45 minutes, scoring just 5 goals while conceding 8.

> 'We recognise the elements of our game that need to improve,' said Arne Slot, Liverpool's manager. While he didn't specifically mention the team's first-half weakness, it's clear that this is an area that needs attention if the Reds are to turn their season around.

## What's Next?
Liverpool will be looking to bounce back from their recent defeats when they host West Ham at Anfield. The match promises to be an exciting encounter, with both teams eager to prove themselves as top-four contenders. With West Ham's impressive start to the season and Liverpool's struggles with first-half weakness, this is a match that could go either way.
