## How Guardiola's Plea for Guehi Could Change the Carabao Cup Final
Executive Summary: Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has called for a rule change to allow Marc Guehi to play in the upcoming Carabao Cup final. The English Football League (EFL) is expected to reject the request, but Guardiola's plea has sparked a debate about the fairness of the current rules.

## Guehi's Eligibility: A Matter of Interpretation
The controversy surrounding Guehi's eligibility stems from a new rule introduced by the EFL, which states that players who have played for another team in the same competition are not eligible to play for a different team in the final. Guehi played for Swansea City in the Carabao Cup earlier this season, before joining Manchester City. Guardiola argues that the rule is unfair and that Guehi should be allowed to play in the final, citing "pure logic" as the reasoning behind his request.

## Key Stats: Guehi's Impact on Manchester City
| Player | Games Played | Goals | Assists |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Marc Guehi | 10 | 1 | 2 |
| Manchester City's Win Percentage with Guehi | 80% |  |  |
| Manchester City's Clean Sheets with Guehi | 6 |  |  |

The statistics show that Guehi has been an important player for Manchester City, contributing to the team's success with his defensive skills and versatility. His presence in the team has led to an increase in win percentage and clean sheets, making him a valuable asset to the squad.
