**England wing Henry Arundell is free to face Ireland in the Six Nations after avoiding a ban for his red card against Scotland.**

## Context / Background
The decision to not impose a ban on Arundell comes as a relief to England, who are looking to bounce back from their defeat by Scotland. Arundell's availability is a significant boost to the team, given his impressive performances in the tournament so far.

## Tactical Key Points
Arundell's pace and agility on the wing will be crucial in England's attack against Ireland. The Irish defense will need to be at their best to contain Arundell and the rest of the English backline.

> Arundell's sending off against Scotland was a major talking point, but his escape from a ban will be a welcome relief to England fans.

## What's Next?
England will face Ireland on Saturday, looking to get their Six Nations campaign back on track. The match promises to be an exciting one, with both teams looking to make a statement in the tournament.
