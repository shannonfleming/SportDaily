**Sheffield Wednesday's takeover saga has taken a dramatic turn with the preferred bidders withdrawing from the process, paving the way for other interested parties, including Mike Ashley, to step in.**

## Context / Background
Sheffield Wednesday has been in the midst of a takeover saga, with several parties expressing interest in purchasing the club. A consortium led by James Bord, the co-owner of Dunfermline, had been considered the preferred bidders. However, in a surprising move, this consortium has withdrawn its interest, citing unforeseen circumstances.

## Tactical Key Points / Stats Table
The withdrawal of the consortium leaves the door open for other bidders, with Mike Ashley, the former owner of Newcastle United, emerging as a key contender. Three parties remain interested in buying the club, with Ashley's involvement likely to generate significant attention given his previous experience in football.

> Although the consortium's withdrawal is a setback, the fact that multiple parties remain interested in purchasing Sheffield Wednesday is a positive sign for the club's future.

## What's Next?
The administrators will now engage with the remaining bidders, including Mike Ashley, to determine the best course of action for the club. The goal is to find a suitable owner who can provide stability and help the club move forward.
