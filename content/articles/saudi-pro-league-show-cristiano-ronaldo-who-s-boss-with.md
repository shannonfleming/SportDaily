## Cristiano Ronaldo's Power Play Backfires
Cristiano Ronaldo, one of the most successful and highest-paid soccer players in the world, has been put in his place by the Saudi Pro League. The league has warned Ronaldo that no player is bigger than the club, after the Portuguese forward missed his second game for Al-Nassr due to a dispute over transfer spending. This move is seen as a clear statement by the league that they will not be intimidated by Ronaldo's stature and will not hesitate to take action against him if he continues to disregard the rules.

## How the Dispute Unfolded
The dispute between Ronaldo and Al-Nassr began when the player expressed his dissatisfaction with the club's transfer spending. Ronaldo, who joined Al-Nassr in January, had expected the club to make significant investments in the team, but so far, that has not happened. As a result, Ronaldo has refused to play for the club, missing two games in the process. The Saudi Pro League has taken a strong stance against Ronaldo, warning him that he will face disciplinary action if he continues to boycott games.
