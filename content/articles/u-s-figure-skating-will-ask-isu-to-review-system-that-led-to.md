    **The US Figure Skating association has announced that it will be asking the International Skating Union (ISU) to review the judging system that led to a controversy in the ice dance event at the recent Winter Olympics.**

## Context / Background
The controversy arose after the French pair of Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron were awarded the gold medal, while the American pair of Madison Chock and Evan Bates took silver. Many felt that the American pair had been unfairly judged, with some arguing that they had performed better than the French pair.

## Tactical Key Points / Stats Table
| Pair | Score |
| --- | --- |
| Papadakis/Cizeron (FRA) | 226.98 |
| Chock/Bates (USA) | 224.92 |

## Key Quote
> 'The judges should be vetted and reviewed' - Madison Chock

## What's Next?
The ISU will review the judging system and may make changes to prevent similar controversies in the future. The US Figure Skating association will also be working with the ISU to ensure that the judging system is fair and transparent.
