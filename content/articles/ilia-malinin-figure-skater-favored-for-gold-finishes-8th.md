**Ilia Malinin, the figure skater who was favored to win gold, finished 8th in the men's figure skating final.**
## Context / Background
Ilia Malinin, known as the 'Quad God,' was expected to dominate the men's figure skating event at the Winter Olympics. However, his performance in the free skate was marred by two falls, which significantly impacted his overall score.
## Tactical Key Points / Stats Table
Malinin's falls during the free skate were a major setback, as he had been performing well in the lead-up to the event. The men's figure skating final saw a number of competitors deliver strong performances, with Malinin's falls ultimately costing him a spot on the podium.
> 'It's really tough to put into words, but I'm just trying to process everything that happened,' Malinin said in an interview after the event.
## What's Next?
Malinin will likely regroup and refocus on his training in the lead-up to future competitions. The experience of competing at the Olympics will be invaluable for the young skater, and he will be looking to bounce back from this disappointment.
