**The Scottish Premiership title race is expected to have more late drama according to Celtic assistant Shaun Maloney.** 
## Context / Background
The Scottish Premiership has been an exciting and unpredictable league this season, with several teams vying for the top spot. Celtic, in particular, has been in the thick of the action, with their recent win against Livingston courtesy of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's goal being a prime example of the late drama that has defined the season so far.

## Tactical Key Points
Celtic's ability to score late goals has been a crucial factor in their success this season. With the potential signing of Martinez to Celtic, the team's attacking prowess is expected to increase, making them a more formidable opponent in the title race.

> The Scottish Premiership title race is far from over, and we can expect more twists and turns before the season concludes in May.

## What's Next?
As the season enters its final stretch, Celtic will be looking to maintain their momentum and secure the top spot. With several crucial matches coming up, the team will need to be at the top of their game to emerge victorious.
