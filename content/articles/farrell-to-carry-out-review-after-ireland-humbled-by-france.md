## Farrell's Fury: Unpacking Ireland's Demolition by France
Ireland's lackluster performance in the Six Nations opener against France has left a sour taste, with coach Andy Farrell vowing to carry out a review after the humiliating 36-14 loss. The Irish side's first-half display was particularly abysmal, with Farrell expressing his discontent and frustration.

## Ireland's Shambolic Start: What Went Wrong
The stats paint a dismal picture for Ireland, who struggled to contain France's attacking flair. The French team's dynamic duo, Antoine Dupont and Matthieu Jalibert, unlocked a new dimension in their gameplay, leaving the Irish defense reeling. Ireland's inability to capitalize on scoring opportunities and their poor defensive record will be a major concern for Farrell as he embarks on his review.

| Team | Points Scored | Points Conceded | Possession |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| France | 36 | 14 | 55% |
| Ireland | 14 | 36 | 45% |
