**The use of Video Assistant Referee (VAR) in football has been a topic of intense debate, with many questioning its effectiveness and calling for reform or even removal.** 
## Context / Background
The VAR system was introduced to help reduce errors in football matches, particularly in relation to goals, penalties, and direct red cards. However, its implementation has been marred by controversy, with many fans and players feeling that it has disrupted the flow of the game and often leads to incorrect decisions.

## Tactical Key Points / Stats Table
| Season | Number of VAR Reviews | Number of Overturned Decisions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2019-2020 | 1,044 | 109 |
| 2020-2021 | 1,211 | 124 |
| 2021-2022 | 1,341 | 141 |

> The debate around VAR is complex, with some arguing that it is essential for ensuring fairness in the game, while others believe that it has failed to deliver on its promises.

## What's Next? (Schedule)
