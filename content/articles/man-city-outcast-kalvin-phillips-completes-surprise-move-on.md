## Executive Summary
In a shocking move, Manchester City midfielder Kalvin Phillips has completed a surprise loan move to Championship side Sheffield United on deadline day. The 27-year-old England international had found himself out of favor at the Etihad Stadium, and a temporary switch to the Blades could be just what he needs to revive his career.

## How Kalvin Phillips Fell Out of Favor at Manchester City
Kalvin Phillips joined Manchester City from Leeds United in the summer of 2022 for a reported fee of £42 million. However, he has struggled to establish himself as a regular starter under Pep Guardiola, making just 12 Premier League appearances for the Citizens. With the likes of Rodri and Bernardo Silva ahead of him in the pecking order, Phillips has been forced to consider his options. A loan move to Sheffield United could provide him with the regular playing time he needs to get his career back on track.

## Key Stats: Kalvin Phillips' Manchester City Career

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2022-23 | 12 | 0 | 1 |

As the table above shows, Phillips has found it difficult to make an impact at Manchester City, and a fresh start at Sheffield United could be just what he needs.
