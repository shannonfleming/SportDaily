**Arsenal's recent performance has sparked intense debate, with some critics labeling them 'bottle jobs' for blowing their title advantage.**

## Context / Background
The Premier League title race has been heating up, with Arsenal being one of the top contenders. However, their recent performance has raised concerns about their ability to maintain their lead. Sky Sports has been at the center of the debate, with some accusing them of influencing the narrative around Arsenal's chances.

## Tactical Key Points / Stats Table
| Team | Points | Goal Difference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Arsenal | 60 | 25 |
| Manchester City | 58 | 30 |
| Manchester United | 55 | 15 |

Some have argued that Arsenal's performance is not just about dropping points, but about the theatrical acts of self-sabotage that have become a hallmark of their games.

> The 'bottle word' will be used, and it's hard to argue against it when you see the way Arsenal has been playing lately.

## What's Next?
As the Premier League season enters its final stretch, Arsenal will need to regroup and refocus if they want to stay in the title race. Their next few games will be crucial in determining their chances of winning the title.
