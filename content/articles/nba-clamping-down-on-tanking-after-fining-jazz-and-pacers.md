**The National Basketball Association (NBA) has taken a significant step in maintaining the integrity of the league by fining the Utah Jazz and Indiana Pacers for sitting healthy players in recent games.**

## Context / Background
The NBA has been dealing with the issue of 'tanking' for several years, where teams intentionally lose games to secure better draft picks. This practice compromises the competitive balance and integrity of the league.

## Tactical Key Points
The league has stated that sitting healthy players will not be tolerated, and teams found guilty will face penalties. The fines imposed on the Utah Jazz and Indiana Pacers serve as a warning to other teams.

> The NBA is committed to maintaining the highest level of competition and integrity, and any actions that compromise this will be addressed.

## What's Next?
The NBA will continue to monitor teams and take action against those found to be tanking. The league's efforts to prevent tanking are expected to have a significant impact on the upcoming season.
